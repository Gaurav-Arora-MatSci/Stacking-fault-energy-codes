Charge_densities_all_plane.py code can be used to extract the charge densities for all the planes in a given direction. The input needed for running the code are:'name of the file' and 'direction'. The name of the file can be input in the last line of the code along with the direction. This code does not output any file (because of 3D and huge size) rather return the array and the name of the file which can later be used to pass onto another function. 

Note:
Specific array can be saved to excel file by uncommenting last 3 lines of the code.
