Charge_densities_for_a_single_plane.py code can be used to extract the charge densities for a single plane in a given direction. The input needed for running the code are:'name of the file','direction', and the plane number. The name of the file should be input in the last line of the code along with the direction and plane number. This code does not output any file (because of 3D and huge size) rather return the array and the name of the file which can later be used to pass onto another function. 

Note:
Array can be saved to a text file by uncommenting line two lines of the code.
